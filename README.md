From our analysis we have created an overview summary of our data findings.  We can see that Rural cities have the lowest number of rides, drivers, fares, and average fare per ride and driver.  Conversely, Urban cities have the highest.

## Fares over Time

By analyzing weekly fares by city type, we see that the total fare amounts by week stay pretty steady over the months, with some weekly spikes in late February and mid March.  Overall, the trends look consistent across all city types, even though the total fare for Rural cities is much lower than in Urban cities.
